Hey all! 
I'm a novice programmer. I truly found programming this past summer working with Visual Basic for Applications during an internship. I didn't know VBA existed prior to the internship, but was challenged by my supervisor to run a complex series of commands "at the click of a button."
I started with trying to manipulate Excel functions to accomplish these tasks. During the process of searching for different Excel functions, I found VBA. It took almost 3 weeks of full-time work, but after many hours on Stack Exchange and similar forumns, I produced the product he asked for.
This spurred my interest in programming. I spent the rest of the internship working on other VBA projects, optimizing many of the back-end business functions of the branch, saving over 700 administration hours annually. 
My experience is limited to a Java class in college and the VBA knowledge I gained this summer, but I'm looking to advance my skills in other languages and turn this passion into a career.
